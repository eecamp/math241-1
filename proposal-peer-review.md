The following is the peer review of the project proposal by team holiday.
The team members that participated in this review are

-   Emma Campbell - @eecamp

-   Harper Lethin - @harlethin

-   ...

-   Describe the goal of the project.

    -   The goal of the project is to compare the ways that movie ratings vary by holiday and why (what factors affect that), and how the run time varies over time.

-   Describe the data used or collected.

    -   The dataset was not uploaded in the data folder and there was no code to load it, but when we clicked on the link, we saw that the data has info about release date, run time, and which holiday it is.The only info about the dataset listed in the proposal were the dimensions (2265x14).

-   Describe how the research question will be answered, e.g. what approaches / methods will be used.

    -   They will make visualizations and use summary statistics to answer Q1 (could definitely use more info about how this will be done, and more specificity about what kind of visualizations and summary statistics). for Q2 they plan to make a scatterplot of runtime x time colored by holiday

-   Is there anything that is unclear from the proposal?

    -   It is unclear exactly what they plan to do for question #1 (what code and what variables).

-   Provide constructive feedback on how the team might be able to improve their project.

    -   The dataset isn't in the data folder and there's no path to load the data. Also, the project and quarto.yml files haven't been updated from adrian's name and the biketown data.

-   What aspect of this project are you most interested in and would like to see highlighted in the presentation.

-   Provide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization.

-   (Optional) Any further comments or feedback?
